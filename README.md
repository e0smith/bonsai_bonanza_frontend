frontend to js "Bonsai Bonanza" project
<h1> Bonsai Bonanaza </h1>

Bonsai Bonanaza is an educational single page application using a javascript frontend and a ruby on rails backend. 
Within this app, the user can view different species used for bonsai trees and their respective care requirements as well as leaving comments on the tree.
As this is only a demo version, the user does not need to sign in.

<h2> Installation </h2>
To download this app, fork and clone both the frontend and backend repo (seperate).
<br>
Within the backend repo, type the following commands into your terminal.
<br>

```
$ bundle
```

<br> 

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

<h2> Running The App </h2>

Within the backend repo terminal to run the server, type:
<br>
```
$ rails s
```
<br>

Within the frontend repo terminal, type:
<br>
```
live-server .
```
<br>
If nothing appears in your browser when being rerouted to your localhost ip, you may have to change the url to:
<br>

```
http://localhost:8080
```

From there you should be all set and able to view the application. Thanks for checking it out.
